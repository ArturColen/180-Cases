# E-commerce website

The project was developed in the course of [Colégio Cotemig](https://www.cotemig.com.br/) whose main goal is to put into practice the knowledge of FlexBox and Grid obtained in the Front-end course. For this, I created a fictitious cell phone accessory company called 180 Cases.
