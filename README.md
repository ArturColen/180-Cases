# Creation of the e-commerce website
The project developed is a coursework of [Col√©gio Cotemig](https://www.cotemig.com.br/) whose main objective is to put into practice the knowledge of FlexBox and Grid obtained in the Front-end discipline. For this, I created a fictitious cell phone accessories company called 180 Cases, as part of the project the creation of the brand's visual identity.
